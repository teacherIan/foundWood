# Production Safety Guide - Splat Reload System

## Overview

The Doug's Found Wood application includes a sophisticated splat reload system designed to be **completely production-safe**. This system ensures users never see unexpected page reloads during normal usage.

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. **Initial Load Phase Only**

- ✅ Reloads ONLY occur during the initial loading screen
- ✅ Once users reach the interactive experience, reloads are **completely disabled**
- ✅ Users can browse galleries, contact pages, etc. without any risk of reloads

### 2. **Multiple Safety Checks**

```javascript
// The system checks these conditions before any reload:
if (initialLoadComplete) {
  // NO RELOAD - User is actively using the app
  console.warn('Splat error after load - NOT reloading for UX');
  return;
}

if (window.DISABLE_SPLAT_RELOAD === true) {
  // NO RELOAD - Explicitly disabled
  console.warn('Splat reload disabled by flag');
  return;
}
```

### 3. **Production Environment Control**

If you need to completely disable splat reloads (e.g., for staging or production), add this to your deployment:

```html
<script>
  // Completely disable all splat reloads
  window.DISABLE_SPLAT_RELOAD = true;
</script>
```

Or in your application initialization:

```javascript
// In production environments
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  window.DISABLE_SPLAT_RELOAD = true;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### ✅ **Initial Visit (Reload Allowed)**

```
1. User visits site
2. Loading screen appears
3. If splat fails → Friendly "Refreshing 3D Scene" message
4. Page reloads automatically
5. Fresh loading attempt
```

### ✅ **Normal Usage (Reload Disabled)**

```
1. User successfully loads site
2. User browses galleries, contacts, etc.
3. If splat error occurs → Logged silently for debugging
4. User experience continues uninterrupted
5. NO page reloads ever happen
```

## Error Logging

Even when reloads are disabled, comprehensive error logging is preserved:

```javascript
{
  timestamp: "2024-12-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0...",
  url: "https://dougsfoundwood.com",
  note: "PRODUCTION SAFE: No page reload attempted",
  errorSource: "SplatWithErrorHandling",
  errorMessage: "Failed to parse file"
}
```

## Files Involved

- `/components/new_experience/Experience.jsx` - Main reload logic
- `/src/App.jsx` - Passes `initialLoadComplete` state
- This guide - Documentation and control instructions

## Result

**Perfect Production Safety**: Users will never experience unexpected page reloads during normal site usage, while developers still get comprehensive error logging for debugging and troubleshooting.

The reload system only activates during the critical initial loading phase when users expect loading behavior, and becomes completely inert once the interactive experience begins.
