# Image Loading Integration Summary

## âœ… Successfully Added "Loading Images" to Loading Screen

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Integrated useImagePreloader Hook**:

   - Added import for `useImagePreloader` from the galleries component
   - Initialized the hook in the main App component to track image loading state

2. **Enhanced Loading Logic**:

   - Updated `shouldShowLoading` to include image preloading state
   - Added `isImagesLoading` helper variable for cleaner logic
   - Loading screen now shows when: fonts loading OR splat loading OR (gallery is open AND images are loading)

3. **Improved Loading Screen Display**:

   - **Main Loading Text**: Shows "Loading fonts", "Loading assets", and "Loading images" based on what's currently loading
   - **Progress Counter**: When images are loading, shows "X of Y images (Z%)" with real-time progress
   - **Status Indicators**: Enhanced status bar shows checkmarks/percentages for Fonts | Splat | Images

4. **Smart Loading Behavior**:
   - Images only show loading when gallery is opened and preloading is active
   - Progress tracking shows actual loaded/total counts and percentage
   - Loading screen stays visible until all critical resources are loaded

### Example Loading Screen Output:

```
ðŸ”„ Loading images...
   3 of 15 images (20%)

   Fonts: âœ… | Splat: âœ… | Images: 20%
```

### Technical Integration:

- **File Modified**: `/src/App.jsx`
- **Hook Used**: `useImagePreloader` from `/components/galleries/useImagePreloader.js`
- **State Tracked**: `preloadingState.progress` for real-time progress updates
- **Loading Condition**: `(state.showGallery && isImagesLoading)`

### User Experience Improvements:

1. **Transparency**: Users now see exactly what's loading
2. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time image loading progress with counts and percentages
3. **Smart Timing**: Loading screen only appears for images when gallery is opening
4. **Comprehensive Status**: All loading states (fonts, 3D assets, images) in one view

### Next Steps for Testing:

1. Open the gallery to see image loading progress
2. Switch between gallery types to see preloading in action
3. Check console logs for detailed loading state information
4. Verify loading screen disappears when all images are loaded

The implementation provides a smooth, informative loading experience that keeps users informed about image preloading progress, especially when opening gallery sections with many images.
