# iOS Safari Memory Management Fixes - COMPLETE

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive fixes to address iOS Safari white screen issues and memory pressure by temporarily disabling custom WebGL cleanup systems and preventing pull-to-refresh functionality.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Disabled Custom WebGL Cleanup System

**Rationale:** Allow React Three Fiber's built-in memory management to handle WebGL cleanup instead of custom implementation that may be causing conflicts.

**Files Modified:**

- `/src/App.jsx`
- `/components/contact/Contact.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Commented out `useWebGLCleanup` hook import and usage
- Disabled `logMemoryUsage` calls throughout the application
- Commented out memory monitoring useEffect blocks
- Removed iOS Safari specific cleanup triggers from Contact component
- Replaced with mock implementations to maintain interface compatibility

### 2. Disabled Image Preloading

**Rationale:** Reduce memory pressure by stopping aggressive image preloading that may contribute to iOS Safari crashes.

**Files Modified:**

- `/src/App.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Commented out `useImagePreloader` hook import and usage
- Replaced with mock implementations that provide compatible interface
- Set preloading progress to 100% immediately to bypass loading screens
- Prevents startup memory pressure from loading all gallery images

### 3. Added iOS Pull-to-Refresh Prevention

**Rationale:** Prevent iOS users from accidentally triggering page refresh which can cause app state loss and WebGL context issues.

**Files Modified:**

- `/src/App.css`

**Changes:**

- Added `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` to both `html` and `body` elements
- Set `position: fixed` and `overflow: hidden` on body
- Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for iOS optimization
- Prevents pull-down gesture from triggering page refresh

## CSS Changes Detail

```css
html {
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  /* Prevent pull-to-refresh on iOS Safari */
  overscroll-behavior-y: contain;
  position: fixed;
}

body {
  /* Additional iOS pull-to-refresh prevention */
  overscroll-behavior-y: contain;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

## Expected Results

1. **Reduced Memory Pressure:** With custom cleanup disabled and preloading stopped, memory usage should be lower
2. **Improved Stability:** React Three Fiber's native cleanup should be more reliable than custom implementation
3. **No Pull-to-Refresh:** iOS users cannot accidentally refresh the app
4. **Faster Initial Load:** No startup image preloading means faster app initialization

## Monitoring

- The custom cleanup system is temporarily disabled, not removed
- Original code is preserved in comments for easy re-enabling if needed
- Monitor iOS Safari stability and adjust approach as needed

## Fallback Plan

If issues persist:

1. Re-enable custom cleanup selectively
2. Implement more conservative memory management
3. Add iOS-specific detection for different strategies

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All changes applied successfully. Code compiles without errors. Ready for iOS Safari testing.
