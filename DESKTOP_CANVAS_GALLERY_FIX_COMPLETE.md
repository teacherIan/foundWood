# DESKTOP CANVAS GALLERY FIX COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## ISSUE FIXED:

### üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Canvas Hidden Behind Gallery**

**Problem:** When opening the gallery on desktop computers, the canvas was completely hidden behind the gallery overlay, making it impossible to see the 3D scene.

**Root Cause:**

1. Gallery component had z-index of 20000 when open
2. Canvas component had z-index of 1 when overlays were active (hasOverlay = true)
3. Gallery took up full viewport (100vw x 100vh) with solid background
4. Canvas was rendered but completely covered by gallery

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

### **1. Enhanced Gallery CSS for Desktop Transparency**

**File:** `/components/galleries/gallery.css`

- Added desktop-specific media query (`@media (min-width: 1025px)`)
- Made gallery background transparent on desktop
- Added backdrop-filter blur effect for visual depth
- Created semi-transparent overlay (85% opacity) for content readability
- Maintained full mobile functionality unchanged

### **2. Responsive Z-Index Management**

**File:** `/src/index.css`

- Added responsive z-index rules
- Desktop (‚â•1025px): Gallery z-index = 2000
- Mobile/Tablet (<1025px): Gallery z-index = 20000 (original behavior)

### **3. Canvas Z-Index Optimization**

**File:** `/components/experience/Experience.jsx`

- Updated Canvas z-index to remain at 1000 consistently
- Canvas stays visible behind gallery on desktop
- Maintains proper layering hierarchy

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:

### **Before Fix:**

```
Desktop Gallery Open:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gallery: z-index 20000 (solid background, 100vw√ó100vh)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Canvas: z-index 1 (completely hidden)
```

### **After Fix:**

```
Desktop Gallery Open:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gallery: z-index 2000 (transparent background, backdrop-blur)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Canvas: z-index 1000 (visible through gallery transparency)

Mobile Gallery Open:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gallery: z-index 20000 (solid background, full coverage)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Canvas: z-index 1000 (hidden, as expected on mobile)
```

### **Key Features:**

- **Desktop Enhancement:** Canvas remains visible with subtle blur effect
- **Mobile Preserved:** Full overlay behavior maintained for mobile UI
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear content separation with backdrop effects
